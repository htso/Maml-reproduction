This maml has been edited extensively to tailor to my experiments on harmonic regression. The original github is 'maml'.

Everything works. Since this thing is written few yrs back, many tensorflow features have been deprecated. So you'll see
few warnings. 

To run my harmonic regression experiments, 

    python main_ht.py --datasource=fun --logdir=logs/fun --metatrain_iterations=100000 --norm=None --update_batch_size=100 --meta_batch_size=10 --train=True

For omniglot,

   python main_ht.py --datasource=omniglot --metatrain_iterations=40000 --meta_batch_size=32 --update_batch_size=1 --update_lr=0.4 --num_updates=1 --logdir=logs/omniglot5way/

To run the code in different settings, see comments in main_ht.py.
